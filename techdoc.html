                        <li> A GitHub repository should also include a licence file and a README file about the project.</li>

                        <li> Any other branch is a copy of the master branch (as it was at a point in time).</li>
                        <li> New Branches are for bug fixes and feature work separate from the master branch. When changes are ready, they can be merged into the master branch. If you make changes to the master branch while working on a new branch, these updates can be pulled in.</li>
